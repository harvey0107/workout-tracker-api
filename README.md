This is the server side for the web application "Workout Tracker", a site for users to create and store workout records of their own. The server was built with JavaScript, Node, Express, and uses MongoDB and Mongoose for database storage. The deployed site can be found here: https://murmuring-plateau-15464.herokuapp.com/

This server interacts with a client application I built with JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap, and SCSS. The links to the repo and deployed site can be found here: https://github.com/harvey0107/workout-tracker-frontend https://harvey0107.github.io/workout-tracker-frontend/

This is the first API I ever built myself, I planned to for building working routes and testing curl scripts before getting into the client side.

In future versions of this project, I would like to include the ability to comment on workouts, so users able to take note on their workouts and markdown anything they need after each workout.
